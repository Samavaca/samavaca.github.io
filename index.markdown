# Welcome to Samavaca

Samavaca is an open-source organization dedicated to promoting the Buddhist principle of right speech (samavaca) in the digital age. We believe that by integrating the wisdom of this ancient teaching with the power of modern technology, we can create a more mindful, compassionate, and awakened world.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to develop open-source projects that embody the principles of right speech, foster understanding, and cultivate compassion. We aim to create a community of developers, designers, and contributors who share our values and work together to build tools and platforms that promote healthy and meaningful communication.

## Our Projects

We are currently working on several exciting projects that align with our mission and values:

- [Chabudai](/chabudai/): A conversational ergonomics framework that enhances human conversations with technology, promoting empathy, context-awareness, and inclusivity.

## Our Philosophy

At Samavaca, we are guided by the four aspects of right speech:

1. Truthfulness: Speaking honestly and avoiding falsehoods or exaggerations.
2. Kindness: Using words that are gentle, considerate, and beneficial to others.
3. Harmony: Promoting unity and understanding, and avoiding speech that creates division or conflict.
4. Mindfulness: Being aware of the content, intention, and impact of our speech.

We believe that by embodying these principles in our work and interactions, we can create a more compassionate and connected world. Read more about our [Philosophy](/philosophy/).
